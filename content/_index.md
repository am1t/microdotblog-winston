description: A Reader, Writer and a Coder

There was a time when this place had to be minimal. Not any more. It was time to go bold, go different. I’m a software developer by profession and a writer by interest. I work at & live in Pune, a city in the western part of India. As per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune), it has been ranked “the most liveable city in India”. I don’t deny it.
