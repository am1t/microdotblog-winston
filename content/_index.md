description: A Reader, Writer and a Coder
---

There was a time when this place had to be minimal. Words and links. Nothing more. Can a writer's overfocus on his words suck the fun out of the process of writing the words? Thought to reflect on. A software developer by profession and a writer by interest. Works at & lives in Pune, [the most liveable city in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune). Loves mystery, humour and philosophy - some combination that. Writer of words for humans and machines.
