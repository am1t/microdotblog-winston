- Working on making the `now` page dynamic. I do not want to manually update this post.
- Curbing my excitement for digital sketch notes. Trying to convince myself that I do not have time for this.
- A [lot of](https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/10/16/anatole-a-twocolumn.html) [dev projects](https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/10/20/since-i-moved.html). Currently, cultivating my [[digital garden]]. I am moving my notes from all the places into a single location. Both at work and off work. The small wins help.
- Build my [[productivity system]]. As much as the p-word is hated, I need a process to manage the sheer amount of tasks vying for my attention.
- I am writing regularly and following a routine of early mornings without fail. I log on to my system every morning and read & write. I am also writing [quick](https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/10/14/i-love-technology.html) [short](https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/10/17/having-more-choices.html) [posts](https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/10/19/being-favourite-vs.html) around an idea.
- I am still working from home, but the days look numbered. There is growing discontent among the decision-makers.
